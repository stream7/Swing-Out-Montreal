  %h1 Listings Policy
  %p
    This page is aimed at promoters and event organisers. I get a lot of requests to list events which
    aren't really a good fit for the site.
    The policy below is designed to pre-empt some of these by trying to codify the criteria that I use.
  %p
    Lindy Hop is a street dance: it has no clear definition and isn't governed by any authority.
    The figures, style and aesthetics of the dance are a matter of personal preference,
    as is the music that it is danced to.
    Swing Out London lists events based upon one particular view of the dance -
    largely informed by the big European swing dance camps.
  %p
    Its hard to say no, so please read this page carefully and if you're unclear on anything, please ask.
    If your event doesn't fit into the criteria below I'll be happy to give you a list of other
    listings sites and services which have a broader policy.

  %h2 Location
  %p
    Swing Out London only lists events on the core London transport network (i.e. places you can easily get a night bus home from!). Check out the #{ link_to "map", "/map" }: if its further out than the outlying events shown, its probably too far.

    %h2 Classes
    %p
      I'd love to be able to list the many one-off workshops happening in London,
      but keeping track of them is much more than I can handle.
    %p
      However, I do often mention particularly interesting workshops on the

      especially those involving international teachers.

    %h2 Social Dancing
    %p
      For non-weekly events, to ensure the accuracy of listings I only list dates which are definitely confirmed:
      I think its better to miss listing an event than to assume it will be happening and risk a disappointed dancer turning up to find it cancelled, changed or moved.
    %p
      A number of music venues regularly host swing bands but don't really have enough space
      for more than one or two couples. These events aren't listed. Examples are

    The table below is just a guideline: a lot of the terms don't have a clear definition
    and I don't claim a deep understanding of what they all mean.
    If you're a band and you're not sure whether you fit into this,
    feel free to send me a recording and I'll let you know.
